Installation of Word of Mouth *should* be as simple as running:

	make
	make test

Or, on systems where the default Make is not GNU's:

	gmake
	gmake test

If that works for you, woohoo! However, if it does not, here are some suggestions for likely places it might get stuck:

First, make sure all prerequisite libraries are installed. These are specified in either the top-level README or the README for the server.

Our Makefiles do some redirection of standard error. If your shell does not support "2>/dev/null" (I'm looking at *you*, C-Shell) try the installation from inside zsh or bash.

Our Makefiles have to do some autodetection to figure out if you have version 2 or 3 of libnettle installed. In particular it assumes that if it finds either /usr/include/nettle/version.h, or /usr/local/include/nettle/version.h then you have version 3+ of the library, and otherwise have version 2. The libraries are *not* compatible, so if it autodetects the wrong library you cannot compile. If autodetection isn't working just remove those lines from the makefiles and add -DOLD_NETTLE to the CFLAGS if you have version 2 of the library.

Good luck!
