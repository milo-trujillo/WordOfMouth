Variables, functions, and methods are all in camelCase. Classes are in UpperCamelCase.

Constants are in UPPER_UNDERSCORE_CASE

Indentation is done with tabs (should we set a standard tab width?)

Braces on next line like:

void foo()
{
	for( something )
	{
		switch( condition )
		{
			case 'a':
				break;
		}
	}
}
