"She walks like a model,
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle,
'Cause I'm the wizard of love,
And I've got the magic wand,
All these other girls are tempting,
But I'm empty when you're gone.

Do I make you feel like cheating?"
And I'm like "No, not really!"

/*Things that this program needs to be able to do:
	-check to make sure that there isn't an empty password file
		-if there is, make one, and request that the user give a password, which will then be used to encrypt and decrypt the information that they give.
	-ask the user to input their password
		-if the user inputs the correct password, decrypt the information and return that info
		-if the user inputs the wrong password, return an error
		-side note: make sure that there's a delay between confirming if the password is correct or not
	-because of the fact that the information is encrypted with the person's "password" the password isn't actually compared to anything,
	and instead relies on the fact that decrypting with the wrong password will return some very odd strings that don't work.
*/

/*Things that this program can already do:
	-Detect whether there is a config file that has been created, and if it hasn't, prompts the user for input regarding the config file.
		-in addition, it can also detect whether or not a file exists, as a side function useable by other parts of the program by including the header.
	-Requests user password.
		-either decrypts the config successfully or unsuccessfully, and returns that result.
			-if unsuccessful, requests the password to be input again
		-detects whether the password field was blank, and requests input again if it is.
			-empties the password variable after each iteration.
	-Regardless of whether the result was successful, it waits 3 seconds before continuing through another iteration, or continuing to completion.
	-If a config file doesn't exits, encrypts the information that the user inputs to create the config file, and read from an encrypted config file if the correct password is given.
	-Detect whether or not an empty password field has been input.
